# NativeStyler

NativeStyler is an advanced styling toolkit designed to enhance the development of React Native applications by providing dynamic, prop-based styling solutions combined with an efficient caching mechanism. This package allows developers to easily apply responsive styles based on the state of the app or component properties, ensuring that your mobile applications not only look great but also perform exceptionally well. With its lightweight architecture, NativeStyler delivers seamless integration into your existing projects, making it an indispensable tool for both experienced developers and those new to React Native.

## Features

- **Dynamic Prop-Based Styling**: Adjust styles dynamically based on props, enabling more flexible and responsive design capabilities.
- **Advanced Caching**: Improves performance by intelligently caching styled components, reducing the need for re-rendering and thus speeding up your app.
- **Lightweight and Efficient**: Despite its powerful features, NativeStyler is designed to be unobtrusive, not adding significant load or complexity to your project.

## Installation

Install NativeStyler using npm:

```bash
npm install nativestyler
```

Or if you prefer using Yarn, use:

```bash
yarn add nativestyler
```

This will add NativeStyler to your project dependencies and you're ready to start styling your components dynamically.

## Usage

Here's how you can use NativeStyler to create a responsive, styled component in a React Native application:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { SafeAreaView, StatusBar, Text, View, useColorScheme } from 'react-native';
import { styled } from 'nativestyler';

// Create a styled component with dynamic properties
const MyStyledView = styled(View)((props) => ({
  padding: 10,
  backgroundColor: props.primary ? 'green' : 'gray',
  borderRadius: props.rounded ? 20 : 0,
}));

function App() {
  const isDarkMode = useColorScheme() === 'dark';

  const backgroundStyle = {
    backgroundColor: isDarkMode ? Colors.darker : Colors.lighter,
  };

  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={backgroundStyle}>
      <StatusBar barStyle={isDarkMode ? 'light-content' : 'dark-content'}
                 backgroundColor={backgroundStyle.backgroundColor} />
      <MyStyledView primary rounded>
        <Text>Hello, styled components!</Text>
      </MyStyledView>
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}

export default App;
```

This example demonstrates conditional styling based on the `primary` and `rounded` properties, showcasing how NativeStyler can be used to adapt styles dynamically.
